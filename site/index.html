    <p id="ClubInfo">STA Coding is one of the coding programs at Saint Thomas Aquinas High School. We aim to take students who are new to all aspects of computer coding, and teach them how to code. We were founded during the 2021-2022 school year by Andrew Dorton, and we have been teaching our members web development.</p>
